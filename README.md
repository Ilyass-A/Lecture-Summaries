# Lecture Summaries
My summaries/notes of the most important AI lectures I took so far as a Mechanical Engineering student at TU Darmstadt, encompassing:
- **Robot Learning**(done, but still working on the "ugly" design and structure)
- **Statistical Machine Learning** (work in progress)
- **Computer Vision 1**(almost done, missing chapter)
- **Reinforcement Learning** (almost done, missing chapter)
- **Continual Machine Learning**(done)
